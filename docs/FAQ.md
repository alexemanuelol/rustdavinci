## Frequently Asked Questions about the RustDaVinci application
 
**Q: Why is there white dots/ lines in my painting?**

**A:** This happens because there is a mismatch between the image ratio and the in-game frame ratio. Let's say you've captured an area that is 256x256 and covers the entire frame, and the in-game frame is 512x512, which means RustDaVinci will only paint 256 of a total of 512 in-game frame pixels. The issue can be solved by zooming in the frame a bit before capturing the painting area, i.e. trying to sync the ratios. NOTE: The larger the captured area is, the longer the painting time will be.
